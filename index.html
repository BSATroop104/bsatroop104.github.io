                        <h2>About us</h2>
                        <p>Troop 104 is the perfect size to ensure that scouts can experience high quality outdoor adventures, explore their leadership potential and receive quality instruction from senior Scouts and trained Scouters. Our program emphasizes inclusion of all scouts from the moment they bridge or join the troop. Younger scouts are placed into existing patrols where they can learn from senior Scouts using the patrol method. Outdoor programs are structured so that activities, adventures and advancement opportunities exist for scouts at all levels. For more information, contact us!</p>

                        <h3>At a glance</h3>
                        <p>We were founded in 1996, meet on Mondays at 7pm at the Elks Lodge No. 735 (5538 Lead Mine Rd, Raleigh, NC 27612), and have at least one outing every month (check out some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg_607gfCJI&list=PLjSucKq0XZiX6I7SQbimJ1W8sjb3ZJuqN&index=21">our previous adventures on YouTube</a>). We do a lot of camping, including attending Summer camp every year, and have produced 100+ Eagle Scouts (26%, where the national average is less than 5%). Scouts have attended National and World Jamborees, Philmont Scout Ranch, Northern Tier, Summit and Sea Base High Adventure camps, and we have incredibly dedicated parental support through Troop Committee and Assistant Scoutmasters.</p>

                        <h3>Visit us</h3>
                        <p>You are welcome to visit any Monday night at 7pm during our regular Scouting season.  We do take a summer break from regular meetings lasting from the first week of July until mid-August. You do not need to contact us in advance - just show up and if you can't find us just ask the first person you see where the the Boy Scouts are meeting.</p>

                    <div class="row aln-center">
                        <h3>Scout Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Scout positions are associated with adult positions: The senior patrol leader works closely with the Scoutmaster; other troop leaders work closely with other adults. No position is completely independent. Cooperation and teamwork between adults and Scouts is essential. Also notice that Scouts with leadership positions have responsibilities to one another. The Senior Patrol Leader manages other Scout leaders and is responsible for their performance. Elected Scout leaders can have appointed Scout leaders to manage, and be responsible for, as well.</p>

<p>Our troop has a number of important Scout positions. The highest positions are elected and serve for a period of time in those positions (a “term of office”). A number of appointed leadership positions are available, with varying levels of skill and commitment required to fulfill. Hopefully, every troop member will be encouraged to accept some kind of leadership position every year in the troop.</p>




                        <h3>Troop 104's Definition of Active</h3>
<p>For advancement to the rank of Star, Life, Eagle, and to earn Eagle Palms, the first requirement in the Boy Scout Handbook for each of these ranks is that a Scout is active in their Troop and Patrol for a set period of time. For Star, this activity requirement is four months, for Life and Eagle the requirement is six months, and for Eagle Palms the requirement is three months. The National Office of BSA allows Troops to set a reasonable definition of active with regards to these requirements. Troop 104 has had various verbal definitions, but none that were adopted and approved by the Committee.</p>
<p>For Scouts in a Position of Responsibility - Attendance and participation at 75% of Troop and Patrol meetings, and 66% of Troop outings during the duration of the six month term OR The Scout needs to negotiate a mutually agreed upon activity contract with the Scoutmaster.

For Scouts NOT in a Position of Responsibility - Attendance and participation at 50% of Troop and Patrol meetings, and 50% of Troop outings during the duration of the six month term OR The Scout needs to negotiate a mutually agreed upon activity contract with the Scoutmaster.

We understand that life is busy for our young men, and we want to have the flexibility to make accommodations when necessary, while not diminishing the importance and responsibilities required for advancement. The activity contract will be a written agreement between the Scout and the Scoutmaster outlining the requirements needed to meet the acceptable level of activity, while taking into account other commitments by the Scout. It shall be the responsibility of the Scout to initiate and track progress in the activity contract.</p>

                        <h3>Individual Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
                        <p>Scout Positions. Scout troops are run by Scout leaders who are elected or appointed from and by the troop’s Scout membership. These Scout leaders are responsible for seeing that the troop runs well, grows, and meets the needs of the members. The number of Scout leaders can change over time, depending on the size and needs of the troop. Following is a summary of the responsibilities of each position in a typical troop. A position description card, the Boy Scout Handbook, the Scoutmaster Handbook, and your Scoutmaster will provide additional details for each position.</p>
